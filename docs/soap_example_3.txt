A - Assessment

Differential Diagnoses:
	1	Mild irritant dermatitis (from soap, climate exposure)
	2	Early seborrheic dermatitis (less likely due to lack of redness or scaling)
	3	Subclinical eczema (mild, no significant inflammation yet)

P - Plan
	1	Skin Care Recommendations:
	◦	Switch to lukewarm showers (limit to 5–10 minutes).
	◦	Use fragrance-free, gentle moisturizers (e.g., CeraVe, Eucerin) immediately after bathing.
	◦	Apply thicker emollients (petroleum jelly, Aquaphor) at night to affected areas.
	◦	Use a humidifier at home, especially in dry indoor environments.
	◦	Avoid harsh soaps; switch to a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil or Dove Sensitive Skin.
	2	Medications/Treatment:
	◦	Prescribed Hydrocortisone 1% cream PRN for any areas of persistent itching.
	◦	Advised OTC antihistamine (loratadine 10 mg daily) if itching persists.
	3	Follow-Up:
	◦	Re-evaluate in 4–6 weeks if symptoms persist or worsen.
	◦	If signs of infection or worsening skin irritation appear, return sooner.

Patient verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan.
